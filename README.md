## The architecture / execution logic of Beego
Beego is a RESTful HTTP framework for the rapid development of Go applications including APIs, web apps and backend
services with integrated Go specific features such as interfaces and struct embedding. Beego is built upon 8 loosely
linked modules that can be used independently or as part of Beegoâ€™s HTTP logic. This high level of modularity gives
Beego an unprecedented level of flexibility to meet developer needs.

Beego uses a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for logic execution.
